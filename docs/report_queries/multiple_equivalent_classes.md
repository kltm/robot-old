# Multiple Equivalent Classes

**Problem:** A class has more than one asserted equivalent classes, anonymous or named. This is probably a mistake, as equivalent statements can be intersections.

**Solution:** Combine the equivalent class statements.

```sparql
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?entity ?property ?value WHERE {
VALUES ?property { owl:equivalentClass }
?entity ?property ?value .
?entity ?property ?value2 .
FILTER NOT EXISTS {
   ?value owl:unionOf ?x .
}
FILTER NOT EXISTS {
   ?value2 owl:unionOf ?x .
}
FILTER (?value != ?value2)
FILTER (!isBlank(?entity))
}
ORDER BY ?entity
```
